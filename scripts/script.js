/* 
  The main game class.
  Structure goes like this:
  1. Constructor launches the newLvl() which accesses the local
  object with questions and places them in the DOM according
  to tags conveniently established in the head.

  2. Also constructor launches the eventListener for clicks which
  in it's term launches the checkAnswers()

  3. checkAnswers() provides a check and iterates the counters.
  After that it launches the nextLevel() which iterates the main
  counter. It's used for the ID pickup from the DB. And relaunching
  the this.newLvl() with iterated ID.
